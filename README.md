# 🔍 AutoComplete Search Engine

An intelligent autocomplete system that suggests search terms as you type — powered by a Trie (prefix tree) for optimized searching. This project demonstrates how to build a full stack search engine from scratch using JavaScript, Node.js, and custom data structures.

## 📌 How It Works

1. **User Input**  
   The user types into the search bar on `Ui.html`.

2. **Frontend Logic (`index.js`)**  
   Captures user input and sends it via `fetch()` to the backend (`server.js`).

3. **Backend Handling (`server.js`)**  
   Receives the query and uses `TrieDS.js` to find matching search terms from `data.js`.

4. **Trie Search (`TrieDS.js`)**  
   Efficiently finds all words starting with the typed prefix.

5. **Response**  
   Server returns matching suggestions, and frontend displays them in real time.

npm install
3. Start the Server
bash
Copy
Edit
node server.js
4. Open the Frontend
Open Ui.html in your browser directly or serve it via Live Server (VS Code extension).

🧪 Sample Data
data.js contains an array like:

module.exports = [
  "apple", "application", "apply", "banana",
  "band", "banner", "can", "candle", "cap"
];

🚧 Future Improvements
 Connect to a real-time database (e.g., MongoDB or Firebase)

 Add debounce for better performance

 Enhance UI/UX with better styling

 Implement fuzzy or typo-tolerant search

 Add unit tests for the Trie
